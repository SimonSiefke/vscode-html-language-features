If an input has no name  specified, or name is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form. (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.)\n\nThere are two special cases:\n\n1.   _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form.\n2.  isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed.\n\n##### name and radio buttons\n\nThe name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons.\n\nOnly one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted,\n\nWhen tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus.

If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached.\n\nOnce one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate thru all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. \n\n##### HTMLFormElement.elements\n\nWhen an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property.

The value can must be a positive number - integer or float -- or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max).\n\nIf any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if we have <input type=\"number\" min=\"10\" step=\"2\"> any even integer, 10 or great, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\"number\">, any integer is valid, but floats, like 4.2, are not valid, as step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\"number\" min=\"-5.2\">\n\nNote: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass\n\nThe default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second, with 900 being equal to 15 minutes.\n\nSee Client-side validation for more information.",

This happens with the JIS_C6226-1983, JIS_X0212-1990, HZ-GB-2312, JOHAB, the ISO-2022 family and the EBCDIC family.\n\nNote: ASCII-incompatible encodings are those that don't map the 8-bit code points 0x20 to 0x7E to the 0x0020 to 0x007E Unicode code points.\n\n*   Authors must not use CESU-8, UTF-7, BOCU-1 and/or SCSU as cross-site scripting attacks with these encodings have been demonstrated.\n*   Authors should not use UTF-32 because not all HTML5 encoding algorithms can distinguish it from UTF-16.\n\nNotes:\n\n*   The declared character encoding must match the one the page was saved with to avoid garbled characters and security holes.\n*   The <meta> element declaring the encoding must be inside the <head> element and within the first 1024 bytes of the HTML as some browsers only look at those bytes before choosing an encoding.\n*   This <meta> element is only one part of the algorithm to determine a page's character set. The Content-Type header and any Byte-Order Marks override this element.\n*   It is strongly recommended to define the character encoding. If a page's encoding is undefined, cross-scripting techniques are possible, such as the UTF-7 fallback cross-scripting technique.\n*   The <meta> element with a charset attribute is a synonym for the pre-HTML5 <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=IANAcharset\">, where IANAcharset contains the value of the equivalent charset attribute.

The content attribute contains a valid CSS <color>.\n*   color-scheme:\n    \n    Specifies one or more color schemes with which the document is compatible. The browser will use this information in tandem with the user's browser or device settings to determine what colors to use for everything from background and foregrounds to form controls and scrollbars. The primary use for <meta name=\"color-scheme\"> is to indicate compatibility with—and order of preference for—light and dark color modes.\n    \n    The value of the content property for color-scheme may be one of the following:\n    \n    normal\n    \n    The document is unaware of color schemes and should simply be rendered using the default color palette.\n    \n    \\[light | dark\\]+\n    \n    One or more color schemes supported by the document. Specifying the same color scheme more than once has the same effect as specifying it only once. Indicating multiple color schemes indicates that the first scheme is preferred by the document, but that the second specified scheme is acceptable if the user prefers it.\n    \n    only light\n    \n    Indicates that the document only supports light mode, with a light background and dark foreground colors. By specification, only dark is not valid, because forcing a document to render in dark mode when it isn't truly compatible with it can result in unreadable content; all major browsers default to light mode if not otherwise configured.\n    \n    For example, to indicate that a document prefers dark mode but does render functionally in light mode as well:\n    \n    <meta name=\"color-scheme\" content=\"dark light\">\n    \n    This works at the document level in the same way that the CSS color-scheme property lets individual elements specify their preferred and accepted color schemes. Your styles can adapt to the current color scheme using the prefers-color-scheme CSS media feature.\n    \n\nThis attribute may also have a value taken from the extended list defined on WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page.

If there are more than one, several <meta> elements should be used.\n*   googlebot, a synonym of robots, is only followed by Googlebot (the indexing crawler for Google).\n*   publisher which defines the name of the document's publisher.\n*   robots which defines the behaviour that cooperative crawlers, or \"robots\", should use with the page.
